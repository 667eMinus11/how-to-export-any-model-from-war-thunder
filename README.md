# how-to-export-any-model-from-war-thunder
 a guide on ripping 3d models/assets from war thunder


To do this you will need ninja ripper 2, wiche costs 5$ on patreon there is a free version (ninja ripper 1.7) but im not sure how well it will work for this guide
Ninja ripper website: https://ninjaripper.com

First ripping models from in game isn't practical we will use the asset viewer and rip from it, download it here:

This program has every model in wt, at first it seems a bit intemedating but its very simple. 
Once you have ninja ripper, and you unpacked the wt CDK, select the asset viewer cmd, from the wt CDK folder, as the executable program, there are 2 cmds make sure its the asset viewer not the map editor

it shuld look somthing like this: (don't notice my horrible speling lmao)

Then press launch, it will take a minute or two to load, and sometimes it opens it and moves the window off screen, if you are exprincing that just press Exit in ninja ripper and reopen it should work the second time.
